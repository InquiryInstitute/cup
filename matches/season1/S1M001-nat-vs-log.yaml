    actor: Arendt
    text: "Thales plays it short to Hume."

  - minute: 2
    type: speak
    actor: Hume
    text: "We begin where we must — with observation. I hold this ball. I feel its weight. I see its shape. And from this, and only this, I will reason. Not from what I wish were true. Not from what must be true. From what is."
    tone: measured
    direction: "Hume stands in midfield. Does not advance. Plants himself."

  - minute: 3
    type: comment
    actor: Rorty
    text: "Textbook Hume. He's not going anywhere until he's established the ground. The Logicians will have to come to him."

    direction: "Russell takes one step forward from the Logicians' midfield."

  - minute: 4
    type: announce
    actor: Arendt
    text: "Russell steps up. He wants the ball."

  - minute: 4
    type: speak
    actor: Russell
    text: "Observation is insufficient. You hold the ball, Hume, but you cannot derive a rule from holding it. You feel weight — that is sensation. You see shape — that is perception. Neither gives you logic. Neither gives you entailment."
    tone: sharp

  - minute: 5
    type: comment
    actor: Rorty
    text: "Russell going straight at him. No buildup, no passing triangles. Just a direct challenge at the point of contact."

  - minute: 6
    type: speak
    actor: Hume
    text: "Entailment. There it is — the word you need and I don't. You need the world to behave deductively. I only need it to behave. The sun has risen every day of my life. I expect it tomorrow. That expectation is not logic. It is habit. And habit is enough to play this game."

    from: Hume
    to: Darwin

  - minute: 7
    type: announce
    actor: Arendt
    text: "Hume releases it forward to Darwin. The Naturalists pushing up."

  - minute: 8
    type: speak
    actor: Darwin
    text: "Habit is more than enough. It is the mechanism. Every organism that persisted did so because it responded to regularity without requiring proof of regularity. The sparrow does not deduce the worm. It acts. That action — repeated, varied, selected — is the ground of all knowledge worth having."
    tone: warm

  - minute: 9
    type: comment
    actor: Rorty
    text: "Darwin in space now. The Logicians' back line hasn't adjusted. Tarski is deep, Frege is flat-footed."

  - minute: 10
    type: speak
    actor: Frege
    text: "The sparrow acts. Granted. But the sparrow cannot tell you what a number is. It cannot distinguish a concept from an object. You are describing survival. I am describing truth. These are not the same pitch."

    actor: Arendt
    text: "Played across to Gödel in midfield."

  - minute: 12
    type: speak
    actor: Gödel
    text: "I want to be careful here. Frege says we are describing truth. I would say — we are describing the limits of description. Any system strong enough to contain arithmetic contains statements it cannot prove. That is not a defect. That is the architecture."
    tone: quiet
    direction: "Gödel remains still. Barely audible. The pitch goes silent."

  - minute: 13
    type: comment
    actor: Rorty
    text: "And there it is. Gödel just froze the entire pitch. You could hear a pin drop. The Naturalists don't know where to press because the claim isn't spatial — it's structural."

  - minute: 14
    type: speak
    actor: Dewey
    text: "Then let me make it spatial. If every formal system is incomplete, then inquiry cannot terminate in formalism. It must terminate in practice. In experience. In the consequence of belief. You've just scored an own goal, Gödel. Your incompleteness is our mandate."
    tone: forceful
    direction: "Dewey steps forward from deep midfield."

  - minute: 15
    type: announce
    actor: Arendt
    text: "Dewey pressing now. The Naturalists are reading that incompleteness result as an invitation, not a wall."

  # ── Midfield battle ────────────────────────────────────────────

  - minute: 18
    type: pass
    from: Gödel
    to: Russell

  - minute: 18
    type: speak
    actor: Russell
    text: "Let me put it directly. Dewey says inquiry terminates in practice. Fine. But practice without form is motion without direction. You kick the ball — to where? Without a logical framework, 'forward' is meaningless. You need rules before you need experience."
    tone: declarative

  - minute: 20
    type: speak
    actor: Quine
    text: "Rules. Yes. But which rules? I've spent my career showing that the boundary between analytic and synthetic is not a wall — it's a gradient. Your logical framework, Russell, floats on the same empirical sea as our observations. You have no dry land."
    tone: measured
    direction: "Quine steps up from the defensive line."

  - minute: 21
    type: announce
    actor: Arendt
    text: "Quine out of position — the Naturalists' defender pushing into midfield. Bold."

    actor: Rorty
    text: "The web-of-belief tackle. Classic Quine. He doesn't beat you at one point — he undermines the whole structure."

  - minute: 23
    type: pass
    from: Quine
    to: Darwin

  - minute: 24
    type: speak
    actor: Darwin
    text: "The framework floats. The organism swims. That is the whole of natural philosophy in two sentences. You cannot anchor knowledge in pure logic because logic itself evolved. It is a tool shaped by the same pressures that shaped the eye."
    tone: warm

  - minute: 25
    type: speak
    actor: Tarski
    text: "The eye can be fooled. Logic cannot. A true sentence is true regardless of the observer. 'Snow is white' is true if and only if snow is white. That correspondence does not evolve. It holds."
    tone: cold

  - minute: 26
    type: announce
    actor: Arendt
    text: "Tarski from deep. The Logicians' defender stepping into the argument."

  - minute: 27
    type: speak
    actor: Hume
    text: "Snow is white — today. On this mountain. Under this light. Your sentence is true by convention, Tarski, not by necessity. Change the language and the sentence changes. Change the world and the whiteness changes. Truth is not a picture. It is a practice."
    tone: measured

  - minute: 28
    type: comment
    actor: Rorty
    text: "This is getting heated. Both defensive lines have pushed up. The pitch is compressed. Everyone between the two center thirds. Only the Tenders are holding their ground."

  # ── Building to halftime ───────────────────────────────────────

  - minute: 33
    type: speak
    actor: Hume
    text: "Wittgenstein is right. Let me mean what I say. I say: the ball is heavier when you hold it longer. Not physically. Epistemically. The longer you carry a claim without passing it, the more it costs you. That is what I observe."
    tone: measured

  - minute: 35
    type: pass
    from: Hume
    to: Dewey

  - minute: 35
    type: speak
    actor: Dewey
    text: "Then let me carry it forward. Knowledge is not possession — it is transaction. The ball moves. The inquiry moves. If it stops, it dies. Every claim is a pass to the next question."
    tone: forceful

  - minute: 37
    type: speak
    actor: Frege
    text: "A pass requires a receiver. A question requires a framework to be a question at all. You cannot transact without grammar. And grammar — logical grammar — is what we provide."

  - minute: 40
    type: speak
    actor: Darwin
    text: "Grammar evolves too. The first language was a cry. The first logic was a flinch. You build your cathedrals of syntax on foundations that bled and ran and ate. Frege — your Begriffsschrift was written by a hand that trembled."
    tone: warm
    direction: "Darwin faces the Logicians' goal. Aristotle is still."

  - minute: 41

  - minute: 45
    type: comment
    actor: Rorty
    text: "I've seen debates end with less said than what just happened in those forty-five minutes. The Naturalists are pressing with experience. The Logicians are holding with structure. Both Tenders are untouched. That's how you know it's working."

  - minute: 47
    type: speak
    actor: Frege
    text: "Darwin said my Begriffsschrift was written by a trembling hand. Let the hand tremble. The symbols do not. Two plus two does not equal four because I feel it. It equals four because the structure demands it. Feeling is noise."

  - minute: 49
    type: speak
    actor: Russell
    text: "I want to push further. The Naturalists keep invoking the body — the eye, the hand, the flinch. But the body is a premise, not a conclusion. We do not reason from bodies. We reason about bodies. The body is data. Logic is the operating system."
    tone: declarative

    actor: Hume
    text: "Here is what I want to say, and I want to say it clearly. There is no impression without a world, and no idea without an impression. You can build all the logical architecture you like, but it rests — every beam, every joist — on something someone once saw, or heard, or touched. Deny that and you are playing a different sport."

    actor: Gödel
    text: "I would like to agree with Hume and disagree at the same time. Impressions exist. But so do structures that no impression can reach. I have proven the existence of truths that no system can contain. Those truths are not seen or touched. They are — nevertheless."
