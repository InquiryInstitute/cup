# 🏆 Inquiry Cup

**Season 1 — Canonical Design Document**

---

## 1. Purpose & Frame

Inquiry Cup is a performed inquiry staged using the visual grammar of football.

**It is not:**
- a simulation of football,
- a debate panel,
- or a philosophy lecture.

**It is:**
- inquiry under constraint,
- staged as competition,
- observed as sport,
- delivered as live performance (scripted, premiered in real time).

The guiding inspiration is the Monty Python Philosophers' Football Match, but with:
- stricter internal rules,
- sustained inquiry,
- and contemporary tooling (Matrix, TTS, WorkAdventure).

---

## 2. Season 1 Scope (Locked)

Season 1 is intentionally minimal and controlled.

- Scripted matches (authored in advance)
- Delivered live, line-by-line
- No improvisation by humans
- No substitutions mid-match
- No real-time physics
- No crowd participation beyond reaction

This is a proof of form, not a full league simulator.

---

## 3. Match Structure (Final)

### Teams

- Two teams per match
- Example: NAT vs LOG

### Formation (LOCKED)

Each team fields:
- **1 Tender** (goalkeeper / epistemic anchor)
- **4 Field Players**

Total:
- 5 players per team
- 10 players on the pitch
- No substitutes

Any deviation renders the match invalid unless explicitly narrated (e.g., red card).

---

## 4. The Tender (Critical Role)

The Tender is foundational.

### Conceptual Role

- First principles
- Axioms
- Ground assumptions
- Reset point when inquiry collapses

### Behavioral Rules

- Remains near goal
- Rarely speaks
- Rarely moves
- Holds the ball during dead play
- Never sits
- Never leaves the pitch

### Visual Rules

- Positioned inside the goal box
- Slightly forward from the goal line
- Visually distinct (posture, subtle aura, or framing)
- Same sprite resolution as others (no scale inflation)

A match must show two visible Tenders at all times.

---

## 5. The Pitch (Updated)

### Geometry

- Standard football pitch markings
- Pitch size increased ~20%
- Avatars remain at the same resolution

### Rationale

- Empty space communicates hesitation and pressure
- Movement becomes meaningful
- Silence reads as intentional
- The ball becomes the focal point

### Spatial Zones

- Defensive thirds (expanded)
- Midfield (more breathing room)
- Center circle emphasized
- Goals fixed at ends (never repurposed)

No benches on the pitch for Season 1.

---

## 6. The Ball (Narrative Object)

The ball represents initiative under constraint.

### Properties

- One ball per match
- Always visible
- Glows subtly
- Has a single holder at any time

### Rules

- Only the holder may initiate a play
- Possession changes via:
  - explicit pass
  - Ref decision
  - dead ball reset

### Dead Ball

Occurs at:
- kickoff
- halftime
- ref stoppage

Ball snaps to center or Tender.

There is no physics simulation. Movement is symbolic and instant.

---

## 7. Movement & Stage Direction

Movement is rare and meaningful.

### Allowed Actions

- stand
- step forward
- retreat
- remain still
- walk off (exit tunnel)

### Disallowed

- running
- crowding
- chaotic motion

Stage directions are authored in script and executed deterministically.

---

## 8. Authority Roles

### Referee

- Singular authority
- Positioned below the pitch
- Interrupts play without explanation
- Issues penalties tersely
- Can confiscate the ball
- Can eject players

Ref interruptions are essential for realism.

### Play-by-Play (PbP)

- Announces time
- Announces possession
- Names speakers
- Frames silence

PbP is the clock.

### Color Commentator

- Context
- Interpretation
- Tension
- Irony

Commentary never enters the pitch.

---

## 9. Identity Rules (Non-Negotiable)

- One faculty = one body
- No duplicate identities
- No name appears twice anywhere
- No one appears on both teams
- All identities are singular and persistent

Violations invalidate assets.

---

## 10. Bots & Delivery

### Faculty as Bots

- All players, Ref, PbP, and Color are bots
- Humans are spectators only
- Bots post to Matrix
- Bots appear as avatars in WorkAdventure

### Audio

- SSML generated by the LLM
- Plain-text mirror messages for Element compatibility
- Custom frontend interprets SSML for TTS
- Stage directions are metadata, not chat text

---

## 11. Presentation Modes

### Element (Matrix)

- Clean transcript
- No SSML noise
- Readable narrative

### Custom / WorkAdventure Frontend

- Live avatars
- Ball visualization
- Movement execution
- Audio playback
- Spatial authority

---

## 12. What This Is (and Isn't)

**This is:**
- performative inquiry
- conceptual sport
- systems art
- absurdist seriousness

**This is not:**
- mass entertainment
- casual gameplay
- debate TV
- edutainment

A small audience deeply engaged is success.

---

## 13. Design Principle (Final)

> Inquiry Cup is not about motion.
> It is about permission to act under constraint.

Everything in this document serves that principle.

---

## 14. Season 1 Status

At this point, the design is:
- internally consistent
- visually legible
- philosophically coherent
- production-feasible

Further iteration should focus on:
- scripting quality
- commentary rhythm
- audience onboarding

—not structural changes.
